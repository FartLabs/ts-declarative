# ts-declarative

üî• Declarative TypeScript class decoration library.

## Background

This TypeScript library is an abstraction layer for annotating TypeScript
classes through decorators and facilitating the derivation of new annotations
from existing ones. This framework provides assistance in developing sure-fire
functions for creating predictable code libraries from annotated TypeScript
code. These libraries would typically require significant manual effort and
expense to maintain.
